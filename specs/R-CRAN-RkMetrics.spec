%description
Hybrid Mortality Modelling (HMM) provides a framework in which mortality
around "the accident hump" and at very old ages can be modelled under a
single model. The graphics' codes necessary for visualization of the
models' output are included here. Specifically, the graphics are based on
the assumption that, the mortality rates can be expressed as a function of
the area under the curve between the crude mortality rates plots and the
tangential transform of the force of mortality.
