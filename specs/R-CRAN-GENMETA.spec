%description
Generalized meta-analysis is a technique for estimating parameters
associated with a multiple regression model through meta-analysis of
studies which may have information only on partial sets of the regressors.
It estimates the effects of each variable while fully adjusting for all
other variables that are measured in at least one of the studies. Using
algebraic relationships between regression parameters in different
dimensions, a set of moment equations is specified for estimating the
parameters of a maximal model through information available on sets of
parameter estimates from a series of reduced models available from the
different studies. The specification of the equations requires a reference
dataset to estimate the joint distribution of the covariates. These
equations are solved using the generalized method of moments approach,
with the optimal weighting of the equations taking into account
uncertainty associated with estimates of the parameters of the reduced
models. The proposed framework is implemented using iterated reweighted
least squares algorithm for fitting generalized linear regression models.
For more details about the method, please see pre-print version of the
manuscript on generalized meta-analysis by Prosenjit Kundu, Runlong Tang
and Nilanjan Chatterjee (2018) <arXiv:1708.03818>.
