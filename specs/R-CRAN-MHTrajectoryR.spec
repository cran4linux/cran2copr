%description
Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting
adverse drug reactions. However, due to their dimension, the analysis of
such databases requires statistical methods. We propose to use a logistic
regression whose sparsity is viewed as a model selection challenge. Since
the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm carries out the
model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion.
