%description
Functions that facilitate the use of accepted taxonomic nomenclature,
collection of functional trait data, and assignment of functional group
classifications to phytoplankton species. Possible classifications include
Morpho-functional group (MFG; Salmaso et al. 2015 <doi:10.1111/fwb.12520>)
and CSR (Reynolds 1988; Functional morphology and the adaptive strategies
of phytoplankton. In C.D. Sandgren (ed). Growth and reproductive
strategies of freshwater phytoplankton, 388-433. Cambridge University
Press, New York). Versions 2.0.0 and later includes new functions for
querying the algaebase online taxonomic database (www.algaebase.org),
however these functions require a valid API key that must be acquired from
the algaebase admin. Note that none of the algaeClassify authors are
affiliated with algaebase in any way. Taxonomic names can also be checked
against a variety of taxonomic databases using the geographic name
resolution service (GNRS) via wrapper functions for the taxize package,
with convenient output format and unlikely names for phytoplankton taxa
removed. In addition, currently accepted and outdated synonyms, and higher
taxonomy, can be extracted for lists of species from the ITIS database
using wrapper functions for the ritis package. The algaeClassify package
is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on
freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by
CESAB (Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS
John Wesley Powell Center for Synthesis and Analysis, with data and other
support provided by members of GLEON (Global Lake Ecology Observation
Network). DISCLAIMER: This software has been approved for release by the
