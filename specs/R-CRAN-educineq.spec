%description
Easily compute education inequality measures and the distribution of
educational attainments for any group of countries, using the data set
developed in Jorda, V. and Alonso, JM. (2017)
<DOI:10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.10.005>. The package offers the possibility
to compute not only the Gini index, but also generalized entropy measures
for different values of the sensitivity parameter. In particular, the
package includes functions to compute the mean log deviation, which is
more sensitive to the bottom part of the distribution; the Theilâ€™s entropy
measure, equally sensitive to all parts of the distribution; and finally,
the GE measure when the sensitivity parameter is set equal to 2, which
gives more weight to differences in higher education. The decomposition of
these measures in the components between-country and within-country
inequality is also provided. Two graphical tools are also provided, to
analyse the evolution of the distribution of educational attainments: The
cumulative distribution function and the Lorenz curve.
