%description
Performs Modal Clustering (MAC) including Hierarchical Modal Clustering
(HMAC) along with their parallel implementation (PHMAC) over several
processors.  These model-based non-parametric clustering techniques can
extract clusters in very high dimensions with arbitrary density shapes. By
default clustering is performed over several resolutions and the results
are summarised as a hierarchical tree. Associated plot functions are also
provided. There is a package vignette that provides many examples. This
version adheres to CRAN policy of not spanning more than two child
processes by default.
