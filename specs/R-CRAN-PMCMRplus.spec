%description
For one-way layout experiments the one-way ANOVA can be performed as an
omnibus test. All-pairs multiple comparisons tests (Tukey-Kramer test,
Scheffe test, LSD-test) and many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for normally
distributed residuals and equal within variance are available.
Furthermore, all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test,
Dunnett T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one
(Tamhane-Dunnett Test) for normally distributed residuals and
heterogeneous variances are provided. Van der Waerden's normal scores test
for omnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one tests is provided for non-normally
distributed residuals and homogeneous variances. The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS
and Anderson-Darling omnibus test and all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Dunn
test, Conover test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well as
many-to-one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, U-test) are given for the analysis
of variance by ranks. Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere test, Cuzick
test, Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman test) are included. In addition, a
Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on ranks (CRBD) and
Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced CRBD is provided with consequent
all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Siegel test, Miller test, Conover test,
Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar test, Exact test).
A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's test for a two-way
balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given in this package as well
as Gore's test for CRBD with multiple observations per cell is given.
Outlier tests, Mandel's k- and h statistic as well as functions for Type I
error and Power analysis as well as generic summary, print and plot
methods are provided.
