%description
Measuring angles between points in a landscape is much easier than
measuring distances. When the location of three points is known the
position of the observer can be determined based solely on the angles
between these points as seen by the observer. This task (known as
triangulation) however requires onerous calculations - these calculations
are automated by this package.
