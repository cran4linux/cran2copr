%description
The presence of outliers in a dataset can substantially bias the results
of statistical analyses. To correct for outliers, micro edits are manually
performed on all records. A set of constraints and decision rules is
typically used to aid the editing process. However, straightforward
decision rules might overlook anomalies arising from disruption of linear
relationships. Computationally efficient methods are provided to identify
historical, tail, and relational anomalies at the data-entry level
(Sartore et al., 2024; <doi:10.6339/24-JDS1136>). A score statistic is
developed for each anomaly type, using a distribution-free approach
motivated by the Bienaym√©-Chebyshev's inequality, and fuzzy logic is used
to detect cellwise outliers resulting from different types of anomalies.
Each data entry is individually scored and individual scores are combined
into a final score to determine anomalous entries. In contrast to fuzzy
logic, Bayesian bootstrap and a Bayesian test based on empirical
likelihoods are also provided as studied by Sartore et al. (2024;
<doi:10.3390/stats7040073>). These algorithms allow for a more nuanced
approach to outlier detection, as it can identify outliers at data-entry
level which are not obviously distinct from the rest of the data. --- This
