%description
Any unverified black box model is the path to failure. Opaqueness leads to
distrust. Distrust leads to ignoration. Ignoration leads to rejection.
DALEX package xrays any model and helps to explore and explain its
behaviour. Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used and have various
applications in classification or regression. Models created with
boosting, bagging, stacking or similar techniques are often used due to
their high performance. But such black-box models usually lack direct
interpretability. DALEX package contains various methods that help to
understand the link between input variables and model output. Implemented
methods help to explore the model on the level of a single instance as
well as a level of the whole dataset. All model explainers are model
agnostic and can be compared across different models. DALEX package is the
cornerstone for 'DrWhy.AI' universe of packages for visual model
exploration. Find more details in (Biecek 2018) <arXiv:1806.08915>.
