%description
This minimalist package is designed to quickly score raw data outputted
from an Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz,
1998) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464>. IAT scores are calculated as
specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003)
<doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197>. Outputted values can be interpreted as
effect sizes. The input function consists of three arguments. First,
indicate the name of the dataset to be analyzed. This is the only required
input. Second, indicate the number of trials in your entire IAT (the
default is set to 219, which is typical for most IATs). Last, indicate
whether congruent trials (e.g., flowers and pleasant) or incongruent
trials (e.g., guns and pleasant) were presented first for this participant
(the default is set to congruent). The script will tell you how long it
took to run the code, the effect size for the participant, and whether
that participant should be excluded based on the criteria outlined by
Greenwald et al. (2003). Data files should consist of six columns
organized in order as follows: Block (0-6), trial (0-19 for training
blocks, 0-39 for test blocks), category (dependent on your IAT), the type
of item within that category (dependent on your IAT), a dummy variable
indicating whether the participant was correct or incorrect on that trial
(0=correct, 1=incorrect), and the participantâ€™s reaction time (in
milliseconds). Three sample datasets are included in this package (labeled
'IAT', 'TooFastIAT', and 'BriefIAT') to practice with.
