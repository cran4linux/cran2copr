%description
Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) system is a collection of multivariate analysis
methods developed for the field of quality engineering. MT system consists
of two families depending on their purpose. One is a family of
Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) methods (in the broad sense) for diagnosis (see
Woodall, W. H., Koudelik, R., Tsui, K. L., Kim, S. B., Stoumbos, Z. G.,
and Carvounis, C. P. (2003) <doi:10.1198/004017002188618626>) and the
other is a family of Taguchi (T) methods for forecasting (see Kawada, H.,
and Nagata, Y. (2015) <doi:10.17929/tqs.1.12>). The MT package contains
three basic methods for the family of MT methods and one basic method for
the family of T methods. The MT method (in the narrow sense), the
Mahalanobis-Taguchi Adjoint (MTA) methods, and the Recognition-Taguchi
(RT) method are for the MT method and the two-sided Taguchi (T1) method is
for the family of T methods. In addition, the Ta and Tb methods, which are
the improved versions of the T1 method, are included.
