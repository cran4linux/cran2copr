%description
A suite of computer model test functions that can be used to test and
evaluate algorithms for Bayesian (also known as sequential) optimization.
Some of the functions have known functional forms, however, most are
intended to serve as black-box functions where evaluation requires running
computer code that reveals little about the functional forms of the
objective and/or constraints. The primary goal of the package is to
provide users (especially those who do not have access to real computer
models) a source of reproducible and shareable examples that can be used
for benchmarking algorithms. The package is a living repository, and so
more functions will be added over time. For function suggestions, please
do contact the author of the package.
