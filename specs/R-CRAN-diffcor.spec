%description
Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between
correlations. diffcor.one() could be used to test for differences
regarding an expected value, e.g., in construct validation. diffcor.two()
may be useful in replication studies, to test if the original study and
the replication study differed in terms of effects. diffcor.dep() can be
applied to check if the correlation between one construct with another one
(r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the correlation of
one of the constructs with a third construct (r13), given the correlation
of the constructs that are compared (r23). The outputs for all the three
functions provide the compared correlations, test statistic in z-units,
and p-values. For diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the output further
provides confidence intervals of the empirical correlations and the effect
size Cohens q. According to Cohen (1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are
considered small, moderate, and large differences, respectively.
