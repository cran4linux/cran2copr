%description
Sensitivity (or recall or true positive rate), false positive rate,
specificity, precision (or positive predictive value), negative predictive
value, misclassification rate, accuracy, F-score- these are popular
metrics for assessing performance of binary classifier for certain
threshold. These metrics are calculated at certain threshold values.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a common tool for
assessing overall diagnostic ability of the binary classifier. Unlike
depending on a certain threshold, area under ROC curve (also known as
AUC), is a summary statistic about how well a binary classifier performs
overall for the classification task. ROCit package provides flexibility to
easily evaluate threshold-bound metrics. Also, ROC curve, along with AUC,
can be obtained using different methods, such as empirical, binormal and
non-parametric. ROCit encompasses a wide variety of methods for
constructing confidence interval of ROC curve and AUC. ROCit also features
the option of constructing empirical gains table, which is a handy tool
for direct marketing. The package offers options for commonly used
visualization, such as, ROC curve, KS plot, lift plot. Along with in-built
default graphics setting, there are rooms for manual tweak by providing
the necessary values as function arguments. ROCit is a powerful tool
offering a range of things, yet it is very easy to use.
