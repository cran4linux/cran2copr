%description
The algorithm implemented in this package was designed to quickly
estimates the distribution of the log-rank especially for heavy unbalanced
groups. VALORATE estimates the null distribution and the p-value of the
log-rank test based on a recent formulation. For a given number of
alterations that define the size of survival groups, the estimation
involves a weighted sum of distributions that are conditional on a
co-occurrence term where mutations and events are both present. The
estimation of conditional distributions is quite fast allowing the
analysis of large datasets in few minutes
