%description
O-statistics, or overlap statistics, measure the degree of community-level
trait overlap. They are estimated by fitting nonparametric kernel density
functions to each speciesâ€™ trait distribution and calculating their areas
of overlap. For instance, the median pairwise overlap for a community is
calculated by first determining the overlap of each species pair in trait
space, and then taking the median overlap of each species pair in a
community. This median overlap value is called the O-statistic (O for
overlap). The Ostats() function calculates separate univariate overlap
statistics for each trait, while the Ostats_multivariate() function
calculates a single multivariate overlap statistic for all traits.
O-statistics can be evaluated against null models to obtain standardized
effect sizes. 'Ostats' is part of the collaborative Macrosystems
Biodiversity Project "Local- to continental-scale drivers of biodiversity
across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)." For more
information on this project, see the Macrosystems Biodiversity Website
(<https://neon-biodiversity.github.io/>). Calculation of O-statistics is
described in Read et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/ecog.03641>, and a teaching
module for introducing the underlying biological concepts at an
undergraduate level is described in Grady et al. (2018)
<http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v14/issues/figure_sets/grady/abstract.html>.
