%description
When working with big data sets, RAM conservation is critically important.
However, it is not always enough to just monitor the size of the objects
created. So-called "copy-on-modify" behavior, characteristic of R, means
that some expressions or functions may require an unexpectedly large
amount of RAM overhead. For example, replacing a single value in a matrix
duplicates that matrix in the back-end, making this task require twice as
much RAM as that used by the matrix itself. This package makes it easy to
monitor the total and peak RAM used so that developers can quickly
identify and eliminate RAM hungry code.
