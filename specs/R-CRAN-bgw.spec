%description
Performs statistical estimation and inference-related computations by
accessing and executing modified versions of 'Fortran' subroutines
originally published in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
journal Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) by Bunch, Gay and
Welsch (1993) <doi:10.1145/151271.151279>. The acronym 'BGW' (from the
authors' last names) will be used when making reference to technical
content (e.g., algorithm, methodology) that originally appeared in ACM
TOMS. A key feature of BGW is that it exploits the special structure of
statistical estimation problems within a trust-region-based optimization
approach to produce an estimation algorithm that is much more effective
than the usual practice of using optimization methods and codes originally
developed for general optimization. The 'bgw' package bundles 'R' wrapper
(and related) functions with modified 'Fortran' source code so that it can
be compiled and linked in the 'R' environment for fast execution. This
version implements a function ('bgw_mle.R') that performs maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) for a user-provided model object that computes
probabilities (a.k.a. probability densities). The motivation for producing
this initial version is to provide fast, efficient, and reliable MLE for
discrete choice models that can be called from the 'Apollo' choice
modelling 'R' package: see <http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com>.
However, estimation can also be performed in a stand-alone fashion without
using 'Apollo' (as shown in simple examples). After this initial version
is available on CRAN, an updated version of 'Apollo' (0.2.9) will be made
available that automatically loads 'bgw'. Additional development can then
occur, including more detailed examples in 'bgw' that refer to 'Apollo.'
Note also that BGW capabilities are not limited to MLE, and future
extension to other estimators (e.g., nonlinear least squares, generalized
method of moments, etc.) is possible. The 'Fortran' code included in 'bgw'
was modified by one of the original BGW authors (Bunch) under his rights
as confirmed by direct consultation with the ACM Intellectual Property and
Rights Manager.  See
<https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/author-rights>. The main
requirement is clear citation of the original publication (see above).
