%description
Implements approximation methods for natural capital asset prices
suggested by Fenichel and Abbott (2014) <doi:10.1086/676034> in Journal of
the Associations of Environmental and Resource Economists (JAERE),
Fenichel et al. (2016) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1513779113> in Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Yun et al. (2017) in PNAS
(accepted), and their extensions: creating Chebyshev polynomial nodes and
grids, calculating basis of Chebyshev polynomials, approximation and their
simulations for: V-approximation (single and multiple stocks, PNAS),
P-approximation (single stock, PNAS), and Pdot-approximation (single
stock, JAERE). Development of this package was generously supported by the
Knobloch Family Foundation.
