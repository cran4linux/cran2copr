%description
Computes the Exposure-At-Default based on the standardized approach of
CRR2 (SA-CCR). The simplified version of SA-CCR has been included, as well
as the OEM methodology. Multiple trade types of all the five major asset
classes are being supported including the 'Other' Exposure and, given the
inheritance- based structure of the application, the addition of further
trade types is straightforward. The application returns a list of trees
per Counterparty and CSA after automatically separating the trades based
on the Counterparty, the CSAs, the hedging sets, the netting sets and the
risk factors. The basis and volatility transactions are also identified
and treated in specific hedging sets whereby the corresponding penalty
factors are applied. All the examples appearing on the regulatory papers
(both for the margined and the un-margined workflow) have been implemented
including the latest CRR2 developments.
