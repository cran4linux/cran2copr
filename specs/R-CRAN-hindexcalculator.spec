%description
H(x) is the h-index for the past x years. Here, the h(x) of a
scientist/department/etc. can be calculated using the exported excel file
from a Web of Science citation report of a search. Also calculated is the
year of first publication, total number of publications, and sum of times
cited for the specified period. Therefore, for h-10: the date of first
publication, total number of publications, and sum of times cited in the
past 10 years are calculated. Note: the excel file has to first be saved
in a .csv format.
