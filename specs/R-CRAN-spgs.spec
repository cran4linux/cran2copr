%description
A collection of statistical hypothesis tests and other techniques for
identifying certain spatial relationships/phenomena in DNA sequences. In
particular, it provides tests and graphical methods for determining
whether or not DNA sequences comply with Chargaff's second parity rule or
exhibit purine-pyrimidine parity. In addition, there are functions for
efficiently simulating discrete state space Markov chains and testing
arbitrary symbolic sequences of symbols for the presence of first-order
Markovianness. Also, it has functions for counting words/k-mers (and
cylinder patterns) in arbitrary symbolic sequences. Functions which take a
DNA sequence as input can handle sequences stored as SeqFastadna objects
from the 'seqinr' package.
