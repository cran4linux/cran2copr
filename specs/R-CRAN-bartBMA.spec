%description
"BART-BMA Bayesian Additive Regression Trees using Bayesian Model
Averaging" (Hernandez B, Raftery A.E., Parnell A.C. (2018)
<doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9767-1>) is an extension to the original BART
sum-of-trees model (Chipman et al 2010). BART-BMA differs to the original
BART model in two main aspects in order to implement a greedy model which
will be computationally feasible for high dimensional data. Firstly
BART-BMA uses a greedy search for the best split points and variables when
growing decision trees within each sum-of-trees model. This means trees
are only grown based on the most predictive set of split rules. Also
rather than using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BART-BMA uses a greedy
implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging called Occam's Window which
take a weighted average over multiple sum-of-trees models to form its
overall prediction. This means that only the set of sum-of-trees for which
there is high support from the data are saved to memory and used in the
final model.
