%description
User friendly functions for power and sample size analysis at one-way and
two-way ANOVA settings take either effect size or delta and sigma as
arguments. They are designed for both one-way and two-way ANOVA settings.
In addition, a function for plotting power curves is available for power
comparison, which can be easily visualized by statisticians and clinical
researchers.
