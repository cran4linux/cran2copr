%description
Provides estimation of simultaneous bootstrap and asymptotic confidence
intervals for diversity indices, namely the Shannon and the Simpson index.
Several pre--specified multiple comparison types are available to choose.
Further user--defined contrast matrices are applicable. In addition,
simboot estimates adjusted as well as unadjusted p--values for two of the
three proposed bootstrap methods. Further simboot allows for comparing
biological diversities of two or more groups while simultaneously testing
a user-defined selection of Hill numbers of orders q, which are considered
as appropriate and useful indices for measuring diversity.
