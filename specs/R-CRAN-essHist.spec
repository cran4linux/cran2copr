%description
Provide an optimal histogram, in the sense of probability density
estimation and features detection, by means of multiscale variational
inference. In other words, the resulting histogram servers as an optimal
density estimator, and meanwhile recovers the features, such as increases
or modes, with both false positive and false negative controls. Moreover,
it provides a parsimonious representation in terms of the number of
blocks, which simplifies data interpretation. The only assumption for the
method is that data points are independent and identically distributed, so
it applies to fairly general situations, including continuous
distributions, discrete distributions, and mixtures of both. For details
see Li, Munk, Sieling and Walther (2016) <arXiv:1612.07216>.
