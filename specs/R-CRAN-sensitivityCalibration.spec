%description
Implements the calibrated sensitivity analysis approach for matched
observational studies. Our sensitivity analysis framework views matched
sets as drawn from a super-population. The unmeasured confounder is
modeled as a random variable. We combine matching and model-based
covariate-adjustment methods to estimate the treatment effect. The
hypothesized unmeasured confounder enters the picture as a missing
covariate. We adopt a state-of-art Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
to handle this missing covariate problem in generalized linear models
(GLMs). As our method also estimates the effect of each observed covariate
on the outcome and treatment assignment, we are able to calibrate the
unmeasured confounder to observed covariates. Zhang, B., Small, D. S.
