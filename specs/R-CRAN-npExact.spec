%description
Provides several novel exact hypothesis tests with minimal assumptions on
the errors. The tests are exact, meaning that their p-values are correct
for the given sample sizes (the p-values are not derived from asymptotic
analysis). The test for stochastic inequality is for ordinal comparisons
based on two independent samples and requires no assumptions on the
errors. The other tests include tests for the mean and variance of a
single sample and comparing means in independent samples. All these tests
only require that the data has known bounds (such as percentages that lie
in [0,100]. These bounds are part of the input.
