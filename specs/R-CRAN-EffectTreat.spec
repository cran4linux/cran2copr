%description
In personalized medicine, one wants to know, for a given patient and his
or her outcome for a predictor (pre-treatment variable), how likely it is
that a treatment will be more beneficial than an alternative treatment.
This package allows for the quantification of the predictive causal
association (i.e., the association between the predictor variable and the
individual causal effect of the treatment) and related metrics. Part of
this software has been developed using funding provided from the European
Union's 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development
and demonstration under Grant Agreement no 602552.
