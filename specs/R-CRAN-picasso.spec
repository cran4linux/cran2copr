%description
Computationally efficient tools for fitting generalized linear model with
convex or non-convex penalty. Users can enjoy the superior statistical
property of non-convex penalty such as SCAD and MCP which has
significantly less estimation error and overfitting compared to convex
penalty such as lasso and ridge. Computation is handled by multi-stage
convex relaxation and the PathwIse CAlibrated Sparse Shooting algOrithm
(PICASSO) which exploits warm start initialization, active set updating,
and strong rule for coordinate preselection to boost computation, and
attains a linear convergence to a unique sparse local optimum with optimal
statistical properties. The computation is memory-optimized using the
sparse matrix output.
