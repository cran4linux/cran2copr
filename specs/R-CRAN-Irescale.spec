%description
Provides a scaling method to obtain a standardized Moran's I measure.
Moran's I is a measure for the spatial autocorrelation of a data set, it
gives a measure of similarity between data and its surrounding. The range
of this value must be [-1,1], but this does not happen in practice. This
package scale the Moran's I value and map it into the theoretical range of
[-1,1]. Once the Moran's I value is rescaled, it facilitates the
comparison between projects, for instance, a researcher can calculate
Moran's I in a city in China, with a sample size of n1 and area of
interest a1. Another researcher runs a similar experiment in a city in
Mexico with different sample size, n2, and an area of interest a2. Due to
the differences between the conditions, it is not possible to compare
Moran's I in a straightforward way. In this version of the package, the
spatial autocorrelation Moran's I is calculated as proposed in Chen(2013)
<arXiv:1606.03658>.
