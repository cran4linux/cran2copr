%description
We propose a method to estimate the probability of an undetected case of
COVID-19 in a defined setting, when a given number of people have been
exposed, with a given pretest probability of having COVID-19 as a result
of that exposure. Since we are interested in undetected COVID-19, we
assume no person has developed symptoms (which would warrant further
investigation) and that everyone was tested on a given day, and all tested
negative.
