%description
There is an increasing interest in investigating how the compositions of
microbial communities are associated with human health and disease. In
this package, we present a novel global testing method called aMiSPU, that
is highly adaptive and thus high powered across various scenarios,
alleviating the issue with the choice of a phylogenetic distance. Our
simulations and real data analysis demonstrated that aMiSPU test was often
more powerful than several competing methods while correctly controlling
type I error rates.
