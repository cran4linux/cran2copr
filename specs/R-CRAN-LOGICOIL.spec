%description
This package contains the functions necessary to run the LOGICOIL
algorithm. LOGICOIL can be used to differentiate between antiparallel
dimers, parallel dimers, trimers and higher-order coiled-coil sequence. By
covering >90 percent of the known coiled-coil structures, LOGICOIL is a
net improvement compared with other existing methods, which achieve a
predictive coverage of around 31 percent of this population. As such,
LOGICOIL is particularly useful for researchers looking to characterize
novel coiled-coil sequences or studying coiled-coil containing protein
assemblies. It may also be used to assist in the structural
characterization of synthetic coiled-coil sequences.
