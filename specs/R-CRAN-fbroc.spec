%description
Implements a very fast C++ algorithm to quickly bootstrap receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves and derived performance metrics,
including the area under the curve (AUC) and the partial area under the
curve as well as the true and false positive rate. The analysis of paired
receiver operating curves is supported as well, so that a comparison of
two predictors is possible. You can also plot the results and calculate
confidence intervals. On a typical desktop computer the time needed for
the calculation of 100000 bootstrap replicates given 500 observations
requires time on the order of magnitude of one second.
