%description
US VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2018 - 06/14/2018. If you want to explore
the full VAERS data for 1990 - Present (data, symptoms, and vaccines),
then check out the 'vaers' package from the URL below. The URL and
BugReports below correspond to the 'vaers' package, of which 'vaersvax' is
a small subset (2018 only). 'vaers' is not hosted on CRAN due to the large
size of the data set. To install the Suggested 'vaers' and 'vaersND'
packages, use the following R code:
'devtools::install_git("<https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaers.git>",
build_vignettes = TRUE)' and
'devtools::install_git("<https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaersND.git>",
build_vignettes = TRUE)'. "The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety
problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)." For more information about the data, visit
