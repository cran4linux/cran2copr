%description
Supervised, multivariate, and non-parametric discretization algorithm
based on tree ensembles learning and moment matching optimization. This
version of the algorithm relies on random forest algorithm to learn a
large set of split points that conserves the relationship between
attributes and the target class, and on moment matching optimization to
transform this set into a reduced number of cut points matching as well as
possible statistical properties of the initial set of split points. For
each attribute to be discretized, the set S of its related split points
extracted through random forest is mapped to a reduced set C of cut points
of size k. This mapping relies on minimizing, for each continuous
attribute to be discretized, the distance between the four first moments
of S and the four first moments of C subject to some constraints. This
non-linear optimization problem is performed using k values ranging from 2
to 'max_splits', and the best solution returned correspond to the value k
which optimum solution is the lowest one over the different realizations.
ForestDisc is a generalization of RFDisc discretization method initially
proposed by Berrado and Runger (2009) <doi:10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069327>,
and improved by Berrado et al. in 2012 by adopting the idea of moment
matching optimization related by Hoyland and Wallace (2001) <doi:
10.1287/mnsc.47.2.295.9834>.
