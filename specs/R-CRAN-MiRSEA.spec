%description
The tools for 'MicroRNA Set Enrichment Analysis' can identify risk
pathways(or prior gene sets) regulated by microRNA set in the context of
microRNA expression data. (1) This package constructs a correlation
profile of microRNA and pathways by the hypergeometric statistic test. The
gene sets of pathways derived from the three public databases (Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ('KEGG'); 'Reactome'; 'Biocarta') and
the target gene sets of microRNA are provided by four
databases('TarBaseV6.0'; 'mir2Disease'; 'miRecords'; 'miRTarBase';). (2)
This package can quantify the change of correlation between microRNA for
each pathway(or prior gene set) based on a microRNA expression data with
cases and controls. (3) This package uses the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistic to calculate an enrichment score (ES) of a microRNA set that
co-regulate to a pathway , which reflects the degree to which a given
pathway is associated with the specific phenotype. (4) This package can
provide the visualization of the results.
