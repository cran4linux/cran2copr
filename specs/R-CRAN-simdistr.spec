%description
Assessment of the distributions of baseline continuous and categorical
variables in randomised trials. This method is based on the
Carlisle-Stouffer method with Monte Carlo simulations. It calculates
p-values for each trial baseline variable, as well as combined p-values
for each trial - these p-values measure how compatible are distributions
of trials baseline variables with random sampling. This package also
allows for graphically plotting the cumulative frequencies of computed
p-values. Please note that code was partly adapted from Carlisle JB,
Loadsman JA. (2017) <doi:10.1111/anae.13650>.
