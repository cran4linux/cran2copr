%description
Genotyping the population using next generation sequencing data is
essentially important for the rare variant detection. In order to
distinguish the genomic structural variation from sequencing error, we
propose a statistical model which involves the genotype effect through a
latent variable to depict the distribution of non-reference allele
frequency data among different samples and different genome loci, while
decomposing the sequencing error into sample effect and positional effect.
An ECM algorithm is implemented to estimate the model parameters, and then
the genotypes and SNPs are inferred based on the empirical Bayes method.
