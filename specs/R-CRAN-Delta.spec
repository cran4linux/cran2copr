%description
Measure of agreement delta was originally by Mart√≠n & Femia (2004)
<DOI:10.1348/000711004849268>. Since then has been considered as agreement
measure for different fields, since their behavior is usually better than
the usual kappa index by Cohen (1960) <DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104>.
The main issue with delta is that can not be computed by hand contrary to
kappa. The current algorithm is based on the Version 5 of the delta
windows program that can be found on
<https://www.ugr.es/~bioest/software/delta/cmd.php?seccion=downloads>.
