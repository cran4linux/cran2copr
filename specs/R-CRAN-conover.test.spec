%description
Computes the Conover-Iman test (1979) for stochastic dominance and reports
the results among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis
test for stochastic dominance among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952).
The interpretation of stochastic dominance requires an assumption that the
CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other. conover.test makes
k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Conover-Iman
t-test-statistic of the rank differences. The null hypothesis for each
pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly
selected value from the first group that is larger than a randomly
selected value from the second group equals one half; this null hypothesis
corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the
rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the
distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location,
Conover-Iman test may be understood as a test for median difference.
conover.test accounts for tied ranks. The Conover-Iman test is strictly
valid if and only if the corresponding Kruskal-Wallis null hypothesis is
rejected.
