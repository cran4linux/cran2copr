%description
Conduct random forests-based meta-analysis, obtain partial dependence
plots for metaforest and classic meta-analyses, and cross-validate and
tune metaforest- and classic meta-analyses in conjunction with the caret
package. A requirement of classic meta-analysis is that the studies being
aggregated are conceptually similar, and ideally, close replications.
However, in many fields, there is substantial heterogeneity between
studies on the same topic. Classic meta-analysis lacks the power to assess
more than a handful of univariate moderators. MetaForest, by contrast, has
substantial power to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. It can
identify important moderators from a larger set of potential candidates,
even with as little as 20 studies (Van Lissa, in preparation). This is an
appealing quality, because many meta-analyses have small sample sizes.
Moreover, MetaForest yields a measure of variable importance which can be
used to identify important moderators, and offers partial prediction plots
to explore the shape of the marginal relationship between moderators and
effect size.
