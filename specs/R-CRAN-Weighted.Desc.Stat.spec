%description
Weighted descriptive statistics is the discipline of quantitatively
describing the main features of real-valued fuzzy data which usually given
from a fuzzy population. One can summarize this special kind of fuzzy data
numerically or graphically using this package. To interpret some of the
properties of one or several sets of real-valued fuzzy data, numerically
summarize is possible by some weighted statistics which are designed in
this package such as mean, variance, covariance and correlation
coefficent. Also, graphically interpretation can be given by weighted
histogram and weighted scatter plot using this package to describe
properties of real-valued fuzzy data set.
