%description
Perform mediation analysis in the presence of high-dimensional mediators
based on the potential outcome framework. High dimensional Bayesian
mediation (HDBM), developed by Song et al (2018) <doi:10.1101/467399>,
relies on two Bayesian sparse linear mixed models to simultaneously
analyze a relatively large number of mediators for a continuous exposure
and outcome assuming a small number of mediators are truly active. This
sparsity assumption also allows the extension of univariate mediator
analysis by casting the identification of active mediators as a variable
selection problem and applying Bayesian methods with continuous shrinkage
priors on the effects.
