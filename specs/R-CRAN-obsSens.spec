%description
Observational studies are limited in that there could be an unmeasured
variable related to both the response variable and the primary predictor.
If this unmeasured variable were included in the analysis it would change
the relationship (possibly changing the conclusions).  Sensitivity
analysis is a way to see how much of a relationship needs to exist with
the unmeasured variable before the conclusions change.  This package
provides tools for doing a sensitivity analysis for regression (linear,
logistic, and cox) style models.
