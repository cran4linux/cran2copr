%description
Using the Bayesian state-space approach, we developed a continuous
development model to quantify dynamic incremental changes in the response
variable. While the model was originally developed for daily changes in
forest green-up, the model can be used to predict any similar process. The
CDM can capture both timing and rate of nonlinear processes. Unlike
statics methods, which aggregate variations into a single metric, our
dynamic model tracks the changing impacts over time. The CDM accommodates
nonlinear responses to variation in predictors, which changes throughout
development.
