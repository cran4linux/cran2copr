%description
'The Proton Game' is a console-based data-crunching game for younger and
older data scientists. Act as a data-hacker and find Slawomir Pietraszko's
credentials to the Proton server. You have to solve four data-based
puzzles to find the login and password. There are many ways to solve these
puzzles. You may use loops, data filtering, ordering, aggregation or other
tools. Only basics knowledge of R is required to play the game, yet the
more functions you know, the more approaches you can try. The knowledge of
dplyr is not required but may be very helpful. This game is linked with
the ,,Pietraszko's Cave'' story available at
http://biecek.pl/BetaBit/Warsaw. It's a part of Beta and Bit series. You
will find more about the Beta and Bit series at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit.
