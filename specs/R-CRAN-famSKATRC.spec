%description
FamSKAT-RC is a family-based association kernel test for both rare and
common variants. This test is general and several special cases are known
as other methods: famSKAT, which only focuses on rare variants in
family-based data, SKAT, which focuses on rare variants in
population-based data (unrelated individuals), and SKAT-RC, which focuses
on both rare and common variants in population-based data. When one
applies famSKAT-RC and sets the value of phi to 1, famSKAT-RC becomes
famSKAT. When one applies famSKAT-RC and set the value of phi to 1 and the
kinship matrix to the identity matrix, famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT. When one
applies famSKAT-RC and set the kinship matrix (fullkins) to the identity
matrix (and phi is not equal to 1), famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT-RC. We also
include a small sample synthetic pedigree to demonstrate the method with.
