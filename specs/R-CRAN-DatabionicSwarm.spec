%description
Algorithms implementing populations of agents that interact with one
another and sense their environment may exhibit emergent behavior such as
self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here, a swarm system called
Databionic swarm (DBS) is introduced which was published in Thrun, M.C.,
Ultsch A.: "Swarm Intelligence for Self-Organized Clustering" (2020),
Artificial Intelligence, <DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2020.103237>. DBS is able
to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional data such as natural
clusters characterized by distance and/or density based structures in the
data space. The first module is the parameter-free projection method
called Pswarm (Pswarm()), which exploits the concepts of self-organization
and emergence, game theory, swarm intelligence and symmetry
considerations. The second module is the parameter-free high-dimensional
data visualization technique, which generates projected points on the
topographic map with hypsometric tints defined by the generalized U-matrix
(GeneratePswarmVisualization()). The third module is the clustering method
itself with non-critical parameters (DBSclustering()). Clustering can be
verified by the visualization and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the
method as a whole. It enables even a non-professional in the field of data
mining to apply its algorithms for visualization and/or clustering to data
sets with completely different structures drawn from diverse research
fields. The comparison to common projection methods can be found in the
book of Thrun, M.C.: "Projection Based Clustering through
Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018)
<DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>. A comparison to 26 common clustering
algorithms on 15 datasets is presented on the website.
