%description
Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between genetic loci, is
known to play an important role in the phenotypic variation of complex
traits. As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to
identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all
of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait
at a time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple
phenotypes can often dramatically increase statistical power for
association mapping. In this package, we present the 'multivariate
MArginal ePIstasis Test' ('mvMAPIT') – a multi-outcome generalization of a
recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect
marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a
given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic
effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis
without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants
interact – thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and
computational burden associated with conventional explicit search based
methods. Our proposed 'mvMAPIT' builds upon this strategy by taking
advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the
identification of variants involved in epistasis. We formulate 'mvMAPIT'
as a multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multi-trait variance
component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter inference and
P-value computation. Together with reasonable model approximations, our
proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized genome-wide association
studies. Crawford et al. (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1006869>. Stamp
