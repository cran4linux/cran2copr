%description
Extensible S4 classes and methods for batch training of regression and
classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Machine, Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors,
Penalized Regression (L1/L2), and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.
These algorithms constitute a set of 'base learners', which can
subsequently be combined together to form ensemble predictions. This
package provides cross-validation wrappers to allow for downstream
application of ensemble integration techniques, including best-error
selection. All base learner estimation objects are retained, allowing for
repeated prediction calls without the need for re-training. For large
problems, an option is provided to save estimation objects to disk, along
with prediction methods that utilize these objects. This allows users to
train and predict with large ensembles of base learners without being
constrained by system RAM.
