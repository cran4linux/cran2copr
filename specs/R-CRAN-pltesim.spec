%description
Calculates and depicts probabilistic long-term effects in binary models
with temporal dependence variables. The package performs two tasks. First,
it calculates the change in the probability of the event occurring given a
change in a theoretical variable. Second, it calculates the rolling
difference in the future probability of the event for two scenarios: one
where the event occurred at a given time and one where the event does not
occur. The package is consistent with the recent movement to depict
meaningful and easy-to-interpret quantities of interest with the requisite
measures of uncertainty. It is the first to make it easy for researchers
to interpret short- and long-term effects of explanatory variables in
binary autoregressive models, which can have important implications for
the correct interpretation of these models.
