%description
In clinical practice and research settings in medicine and the behavioral
sciences, it is often of interest to quantify the correlation of a
continuous endpoint that was repeatedly measured (e.g., test-retest
correlations, ICC, etc.). This package allows for estimating these
correlations based on mixed-effects models. Part of this software has been
developed using funding provided from the European Union's 7th Framework
Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under
Grant Agreement no 602552.
