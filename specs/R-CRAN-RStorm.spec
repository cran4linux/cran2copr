%description
While streaming processing provides opportunities to deal with extremely
large and ever growing data sets in (near) real time, the development of
streaming algorithms for complex models is often cumbersome: the software
packages that facilitate streaming processing in production environments
do not provide statisticians with the simulation, estimation, and plotting
tools they are used to. Developers of streaming algorithms would thus
benefit from the flexibility of [R] to create, plot and compute data while
developing streaming algorithms. Package RStorm implements a streaming
architecture modeled on Storm for easy development and testing of
streaming algorithms in [R]. RStorm is not intended as a production
package, but rather a development tool for streaming algorithms.
