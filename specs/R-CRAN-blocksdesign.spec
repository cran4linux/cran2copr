%description
Constructs treatment and block designs for linear treatment models with
crossed or nested block factors. The treatment design can be any feasible
linear model and the block design can be any feasible combination of
crossed or nested block factors. The block design is a sum of one or more
block factors and the block design is optimized sequentially with the
levels of each successive block factor optimized conditional on all
previously optimized block factors. D-optimality is used throughout except
for square or rectangular lattice block designs which are constructed
algebraically using mutually orthogonal Latin squares. Crossed block
designs with interaction effects are optimized using a weighting scheme
which allows for differential weighting of first and second-order block
effects. Outputs include a table showing the allocation of treatments to
blocks and tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block
and treatment design. Edmondson, R.N. Multi-level Block Designs for
