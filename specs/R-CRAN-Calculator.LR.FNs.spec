%description
Arithmetic operations scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division of LR fuzzy numbers (which are on the basis of
extension principle) have a complicate form for using in fuzzy Statistics,
fuzzy Mathematics, machine learning, fuzzy data analysis and etc.
Calculator for LR Fuzzy Numbers package relieve and aid applied users to
achieve a simple and closed form for some complicated operator based on LR
fuzzy numbers and also the user can easily draw the membership function of
the obtained result by this package.
