%description
An implementation of the algorithm described in "Efficient Large- Scale
Internet Media Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising" by
Paulson, Luo, and James (Journal of Marketing Research 2018; see URL below
for journal text/citation and
<http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/Research/ELMSO.pdf> for a
full-text version of the paper). The algorithm here is designed to
allocate budget across a set of online advertising opportunities using a
coordinate-descent approach, but it can be used in any resource-allocation
problem with a matrix of visitation (in the case of the paper, website
page- views) and channels (in the paper, websites). The package contains
allocation functions both in the presence of bidding, when allocation is
dependent on channel-specific cost curves, and when advertising costs are
fixed at each channel.
