%description
Utilities are provided which are of use in the packages I have developed
for dealing with distributions. Currently these packages are
GeneralizedHyperbolic, VarianceGamma, and SkewHyperbolic and
NormalLaplace. Each of these packages requires DistributionUtils.
Functionality includes sample skewness and kurtosis, log-histogram, tail
plots, moments by integration, changing the point about which a moment is
calculated, functions for testing distributions using inversion tests and
the Massart inequality. Also includes an implementation of the incomplete
Bessel K function.
